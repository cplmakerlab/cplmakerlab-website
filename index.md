## Chicago Public Library Maker Lab

The Maker Lab, Chicagoâ€™s first free and publicly accessible maker space, is on the 3rd floor of Harold Washington Library Center. The Maker Lab features introductory [workshops](http://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/events#/events/search/fq=program:&#40;53f20a07e04c1e3b1c00d3e4&#41;){: target="_blank"} and [open shop](https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/events/search/q=%22Open%20Shop%22&amp;fq=program:&#40;53f20a07e04c1e3b1c00d3e4&#41;){: target="_blank"} for personal projects and collaboration. We encourage you to explore the full range of making, both high-tech and hands-on.
