## Electronic Cutter Basics

An electronic cutter (or e-cutter) is a handy machine that can cut flat materials such as vinyl, heat transfers, and paper using a computer. They are great for making vinyl stickers, letters, signs, paper crafts, greeting cards, and more\!

At the Maker Lab we use a Cricut, although we also have an older Cameo machine. Both are about the size of a desktop printer and come with their own special software to use with the machine.
