faq:
  - question: What is the Maker Lab?
    answer: The Maker Lab is a free resource to create cool stuff.
  - question: Where are you located?

      The Maker Lab has several locations, but the main one is on the 3rd floor
      of Harold Washington Library.
  - question: What is a static file?
    answer: >-
      A static file is a file that does not contain any YAML front matter. These
      include images, PDFs, and other un-rendered content.
  - question: What is a collection?
    answer: >-
      Not everything is a post or a page. Maybe you want to document the various
      methods in your open source project, members of a team, or talks at a
      conference. Collections allow you to define a new type of document that
      behave like Pages or Posts do normally, but also have their own unique
      properties and namespace.
  - question: What is a data file?
    answer: >-
      In addition to the built-in variables available from Jekyll, you can
      specify your own custom data that can be accessed via the Liquid
      templating system. Jekyll supports loading data from YAML, JSON, and CSV
      files located in the  `_data` directory. Note that CSV files must contain
      a header row.
